build only accepts a single positional argument: package name, but multiple were specified
Build compiles the packages named by the import paths, along with their
dependencies, but it does not install the results. The output binary is
specified using the -o parameter. The generated file type depends on the
extension:

	.o:
			Create a relocatable object file. You can use this option if you
			don't want to use the TinyGo build system or want to do other custom
			things.

	.ll:
			Create textual LLVM IR, after optimization. This is mainly useful
			for debugging.

	.bc:
			Create LLVM bitcode, after optimization. This may be useful for
			debugging or for linking into other programs using LTO.

	.hex:
			Create an Intel HEX file to flash it to a microcontroller.

	.bin:
			Similar, but create a binary file.

	.wasm:
			Compile and link a WebAssembly file.

(all other) Compile and link the program into a regular executable. For
microcontrollers, it is common to use the .elf file extension to indicate a
linked ELF file is generated. For Linux, it is common to build binaries with no
extension at all.
